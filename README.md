<h1>Hey, I'm Abolfazl ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<strong>I'm a frontend developer, optimist, and philosopher. I currently work on <a href='https://www.satalia.com/'>Satalia</a> projects at  <a href='https://www.vml.com/'>VML</a>, where we use AI to optimize supply chain performance for our clients. Over the past five years, I have participated in a variety of projects from large, well-established companies with more than 1 million users to small ventures.
